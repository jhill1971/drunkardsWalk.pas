This program simulates the random staggering of Sam the Drunk
across a bridge. Starting from the center, he takes steps towards the right or 
left banks in one-foot increments. Happily, he will stay on the bridge and not 
fall to the water below to be devoured by alligators, piranha fish, and snapping
turtles. The program will calculate how many steps it takes for Sam to reach 
either the right or left bank.
